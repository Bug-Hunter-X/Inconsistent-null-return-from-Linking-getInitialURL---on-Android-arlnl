This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` async function sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, leading to unexpected behavior in the application. This is especially problematic on Android devices and is inconsistent across different devices and Android versions. The issue seems to stem from the way Expo handles the initial URL retrieval and its interaction with the underlying Android system.
